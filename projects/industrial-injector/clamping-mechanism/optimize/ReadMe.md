# Clamping mechanism optimization


To analyse and optimize the link lengths of a 5 point double toggle clamping mechanism, a genetic algorithm can be used.

A machine learning tool to visualise and execute this process is proposed herein

Objective: To dynamicaly model and visualize a 5 point double toggle mechanism based on user input dimensions and to calculate optimum link lengths for given combinations of parameters



Language: Python - Anaconda distribution (which includes lots of modules and jupyter notebooks)

Development environment: [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)

Presentation: Standalone web-based app via Jupiter notebooks Viola

Creat development environment:

Download and install Anaconda (includes Python)

Open Anaconda, create a new environment, then in the Home tab open Jupyter Notebooks. Finally open a new notebook which opens in your web browser.
Note- I had to [download SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) and place it in the DLLLs folder to get Notebooks to run
