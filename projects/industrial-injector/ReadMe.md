#Industrial Scale Injector

## Intro

It is percieved that in the future there will be a demand for larger scale injection machines designed exclusively for 

recycled plastic. The current (v4) Precious Plastic machines approach a small industrial scale, but to reach a profitable 

production rate for injected products, a bigger, automated machine will be required.


One of the most popular products in the PP catalogue is the Brick. This is currently produced using the v4 extruder into a 

removable mould. Relatively high production rates can theoretically be achieved using multiple moulds, but the process of 

switching moulds over and demoulding the product is labour intensive, meaning that the production cost per product remains 

high.




## Objective

It is proposed that an open-source design should be developed for a large scale injection machine, based on industrial 

principles, which is capable of producing items as large as the brick at high speed with full automation. The development of this project is described herein.


## Baseline Criteria

- Should be able to use 100% recycled HDPE shred as feedstock

- Should be able to produce products roughly equal in size and volume to the PP Brick
 
-- 200x100x150mm 

-- 1kg shot size


- Should produce such a product fully automatically at a profitable rate: Suggested 45 per hour countinuously

- Should be affordable as a community investment and possible to build with a standard machine shop toolset




## Industrial injection machines - existing design principles

Industrial injection machines commonly feature certain design elements which have not yet been fully explored by the PP 

movement. Most importantly these are:

- Hydraulic actuation

- 5 point double toggle clamping

- Heavy duty moulds with cooling and ejection

- Injection screw with Checking Ring set
