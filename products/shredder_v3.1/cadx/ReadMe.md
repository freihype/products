Overhaul of Shredder 3.1

Rebuilding with native Solidworks geometry instead of imported iges files

06.05.20 Shredderbox assembly completed as SW geometry, not including bearings and bearing mounts./ time 8hrs


Notes..
Check hole sizes on counterknives and counterknife spacers .. 10.5mm?

Check fixing method for black bearing mounts

bearing block can remain as iges?

bearing insert?

Hopper parts missing... locate or redraw

07.05

Redbuilt hopper from laser files

Rebuilt Shields

Added bearings with housings, bearing mounts and spacers

in process of adding gearbox, coupling, rebuilt base plate

added gearbox downloaded from Motovario

Notes..

check small holes diam at bottom of main plate = 5mm?

Bearing - different to previous - UCFL206-30 has a 30mm bore - previous did not fit - maybe was uc205 pattern?

NB this means the bolt spacing is wider- 117mm instead of 99mm previously ... do the bolts go into the main plate? if so they may crash with the tab of the frame plate?

Gearbox has 1mm gap below and fence is 34mm not 33 - need to figure out where the discrepancy is
