Overhaul of Shredder 3.1

Rebuilding with native Solidworks geometry instead of imported iges files

06.05.20 Shredderbox assembly completed as SW geometry, not including bearings and bearing mounts./ time 8hrs


Notes..
Check hole sizes on counterknives and counterknife spacers .. 10.5mm?

Check fixing method for black bearing mounts

bearing block can remain as iges?

bearing insert?

Hopper parts missing... locate or redraw



07.05

Redbuilt hopper from laser files

Rebuilt Shields

Added bearings with housings, bearing mounts and spacers

in process of adding gearbox, coupling, rebuilt base plate

added gearbox downloaded from Motovario

Notes..

check small holes diam at bottom of main plate = 5mm?

Bearing - different to previous - UCFL206-30 has a 30mm bore - previous did not fit - maybe was uc205 pattern?

NB this means the bolt spacing is wider- 117mm instead of 99mm previously ... do the bolts go into the main plate? if so they may crash with the tab of the frame plate?

Gearbox has 1mm gap below and fence is 34mm not 33 - need to figure out where the discrepancy is

time 8hrs


08.05.20

Located and corrected 1mm error in heights of Shredderbox mounts, corrected fence height to 33mm

Rebuilt legs with hollow square section tube and built fixing system with 10mm threaded bar

Built base plate extension for central legs under reducer

Built new couplings with configs for 24, 30 and 35mm bore, 10mm keyways

In process of adding screw and barrel arrangement but not sure im seeing it right....

Notes..

The rebuilt coupling is a bit different to the previous one, I reduced the ID of the star ring to give larger contact surface between the two halves of the coupling. Not sure if the star needs to have a hole in the middle? 

time 6hrs ish but will continue for a bit..
