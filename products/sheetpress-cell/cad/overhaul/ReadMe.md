## Sheetpress-Cell CAD Overhaul

Here I will document my work to tidy up and overhaul the CAD files for the Sheetpress.

Commenced 03/05/20


03/05 

Started to find my way around the model. 

Got rid of a number of mates errors. 

Discovered a number of parts are imported rather than native so decided to rebuild the frame and slider mechanism.

Rebuilt frame using mirror components

Rebuilt Slider mechanism as 2 separate assemblies to allow movement

Rebuilt press plate frame with separate side rails for top and bottom

Removed most nuts and bolts to re add later using mirrors


Notes: 

New frame does not look as good because of joints. Weld does not work on filleted edge. To be addressed.

Dimensional tolerance on width is tight

Lots of work still to simplify the pressing plate assembly

Need to confirm how much metal has already been cut

NB Hole positions on frame ARE slightly different to previous model, to give 350mm and 700mm centres where possible


Committing Sheetpress-overhaul-0.1
Main working assembly is Sheetpress Global Assembly 0.1 (Current work in progress)

time: 12hrs
